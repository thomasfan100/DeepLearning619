#Project 4
You are a data scientist in an agriculture company. You are given a dataset of images of beans taken in the field using smartphone cameras. It consists of 3 classes: 2 disease classes and the healthy class. Diseases depicted include Angular Leaf Spot and Bean Rust. Data was annotated by experts from the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in Uganda and collected by the Makerere AI research lab.

You are asked to perform image classification with the label having 3 classes.
Build a CNN network to perform image classification using TensorFlow. 
Build a CNN network using data augmentation, transfer learning, and TensorFlow by choosing a pre-trained model. 

#Project 5 
You are a data scientist in an e-commerce company. You are given a Womenâ€™s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers.
Build an RNN model to forecast the Recommended IND based on Reviews using TensorFlow.

#Project 6
You are a data scientist in a call center. You are given a tab-delimited bilingual sentence pair contained in the file, deu-eng.txt
Develop an encoder for the model.
Develop a decoder for the model.

#Project 7
You are a data scientist in an entertainment company. You are given a MovieLens dataset. It includes around 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies, along with some user features, movie genres. In addition, the timestamp of each user-movie rating is provided, which allows creating sequences of movie ratings for each user, as expected by the BST model.
You are asked to develop a Transformer-based recommendation system.
Transform the movie ratings data into sequences.
Create a BST model.

#Project 8
You are a data scientist in a business shipping company. You are asked to generate images of handwritten digits using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).
You are asked to develop a DCGAN model.
Create the Generator.
Create the discriminator.


#Final Project
Part I
You are a data scientist in an AI company. You are given a dataset of images containing over 15,000 images of indoor locations. The dataset was originally from MIT built to tackle the problem of indoor scene recognition. All images are in JPEG format and have been divided into 67 categories. The number of images per category varies. However, there are at least 100 images for each category. 
Build a CNN model with data augmentation and dropout 
Build a CNN model based on the pre-trained model(transfer learning)

Part II
You are a data scientist in an AI company. You are given a dataset of restaurant reviews. This is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets with six columns:
Build a RNN model using embedding layer and GRU and LSTM on the training dataset and evaluate it on the test dataset.
